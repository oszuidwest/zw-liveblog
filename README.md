# ZuidWest Liveblog

This WordPress plugin is designed to embed 24LiveBlog liveblog posts into a website. It replaces the shortcode `[liveblog id="123456"]` with the appropriate 24LiveBlog embed code.

The plugin also contains some ugly CSS hacks. It automatically hides advertisements within the liveblog by not displaying the associated div and adds styling for dark mode.

## Usage

After activating the plugin, you can embed a liveblog into any post or page by using the following shortcode:

```html
[liveblog id="YOUR_LIVEBLOG_ID"]
```
